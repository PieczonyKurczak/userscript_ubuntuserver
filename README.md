Hello stranger!

Here is a small, quickly created script which can be helpful at work to create multiple users, groups, directories, etc.

Script must be executed with sudo, why? Because no sudo = no creation of users, groups,...

Script is in German language. This script may not work at your enviroment.

This shell script will be updated and expanded frequently in the near future.
